## Machine Learning Jupyter Notebooks

The notebooks inside this folder are part of Stanford's Online Machine Learning course, taught by Andrew NG. It's a very interesting course, with hands-on activities on different topics, such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, Dimensionality Reduction, among others.
These notebooks assignments are part of the aforementioned course and have been adapted to python by [dibgerge](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments).
For running this environment, conda is being used.
